In SQL, a common yet often overlooked error involves the implicit type conversion that occurs when comparing values of different data types. For example, comparing a numeric column with a string column might lead to unexpected results depending on the database system's implicit conversion rules. This often results in incorrect query results or unexpected behavior in stored procedures or functions.  Consider this example:

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE employee_id = '123';
```

If `employee_id` is an integer column, some database systems might implicitly convert '123' to an integer, performing the comparison correctly. However, others may treat this comparison differently, leading to inaccurate results if there's a mismatch in data type or a conversion error.

Another subtle error is the misuse of NULL values. Comparisons involving NULL using the `=` operator will always return false, even when the other value is also NULL.  You must use the `IS NULL` or `IS NOT NULL` operators when checking for NULL values.  Incorrect use can result in incorrect filtering or joins, as in this example:

```sql
SELECT * FROM orders WHERE customer_id = NULL; -- Incorrect!
SELECT * FROM orders WHERE customer_id IS NULL; -- Correct!
```
