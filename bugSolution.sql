To avoid implicit type conversion errors, always ensure that data types match in comparisons. Explicitly cast values to the appropriate data type if necessary.  For instance:

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE employee_id = CAST('123' AS INT);
```

This explicitly casts the string '123' to an integer, eliminating ambiguity.

To correctly handle NULL values, always use the `IS NULL` or `IS NOT NULL` operators, never the `=` operator.  Furthermore, for equality checks involving NULL values, consider using `COALESCE` to replace them with a default value. For example:

```sql
SELECT * FROM orders WHERE COALESCE(customer_id, 0) = 0; -- Treats NULL customer_id as 0
```

This approach replaces NULL `customer_id` values with 0 before comparison, making the query behavior more predictable.
